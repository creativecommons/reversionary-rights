Bernt Hugenholtz,https://www.ivir.nl/publicaties/download/1729.pdf,,"""[404] Art. 25e establishes the right to dissolve an exploitation contract in case of non-usus. This ‘use-it-or-lose-it’ provision allows authors to terminate an agreement if the ‘exploiter’ of his work fails to “sufficiently exploit the copyright in the work within a reasonable period after having concluded the contract, or does not sufficiently exploit the copyright after having initially performed acts of exploitation.” The Explanatory Memorandum accompanying the bill offers an interesting economic argument for this legislative intervention. By allowing authors to recover rights not properly exploited, unused catalogs of rights will be revived and competition between intermediaries will be enhanced. A termination of transfer does not require judicial intervention; a written notice to the author’s counterpart will suffice. The assignee will thereafter have the burden of proving that he has sufficiently exploited the work. Upon termination, the assignee is obliged to transfer the right back to the author. Authors may also invoke the right of termination and reversion against third party rightholders."""
Lucie Guibault,Netherlands,New copyright contract law aims to improve position of authors and performing artists,De Brauw Blackstone Westbroek,https://www.debrauw.com/newsletter/new-copyright-contract-law-aims-improve-position-authors-performing-artists/?output=pdf,,"""Non-use clause If the producer does not exploit the author’s work within a reasonable period, the author has the right to terminate the agreement. But this right can only be invoked if the author alerts the producer in writing, granting the author the opportunity to exploit or re-exploit the work within a reasonable period following the notice (unless exploitation is no longer possible). The non-use clause does not apply if the non-exploitation can be attributed to the author or if the producer has a major interest in continuing the contract that overrules the author’s interests, all according to the principles of reasonableness and fairness. In practice, interpretation issues can be avoided by adding a clause that specifies what parties consider a reasonable period. The non-use clause applies retroactively."""
Lucie Guibault,Netherlands,"Annotatie op ""Nanada/Golden Earring Hoge Raad 7 juli 2017, ECLI:NL:HR:2017:1270""",P. Bernt Hugenholtz,https://www.ivir.nl/publicaties/download/Annotatie_AMI_2018_2.pdf,,"""Publishing contracts which have been concluded for an indefinite period can in principle be canceled, with transferred rights being returned. The judgment also teaches that authors and artists who want to put an end to exploitation agreements do not need to rely only on the new copyright contract law. Next to the arsenal of mandatory provisions of Chapter Ia Copyright Act (right to equitable remuneration, best seller determination, non-usus rule and invalidation of unreasonably onerous clauses) the general rules of law play an important role in the protection of authors and artists against unfair contractual practices. This applies in particular for the possibility explicitly recognized in the Golden Earring judgment to cancel an operating agreement, a power which is not regulated in Chapter Ia Copyright Act. In addition, the reasonableness and fairness require the operator to retro-transfer the rights granted. Admittedly sufficiently serious grounds will in principle be required before an agreement can be terminated, but long-term exploitation agreements for which the investments of the music publishers are recouped appear can apparently be cancelled. In practice this could mean that the dissolution scheme of art. 25 (e) Copyright Act will be invoked especially in the case of exploitation agreements for a fixed term."""
